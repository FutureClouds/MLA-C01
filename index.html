Q: Case Study - A company is building a web-based AI application by using Amazon SageMaker. The application will provide the following capabilities and features: ML experimentation, training, a central model registry, model deployment, and model monitoring. The application must ensure secure and isolated use of training data during the ML lifecycle. The training data is stored in Amazon S3. The company needs to use the central model registry to manage different versions of models in the application. Which action will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?
A. Create a separate Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository for each model.
B. Use Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) and unique tags for each model version.
*C. Use the SageMaker Model Registry and model groups to catalog the models.
D. Use the SageMaker Model Registry and unique tags for each model version.

Q: Case Study - A company is building a web-based AI application by using Amazon SageMaker. The application will provide the following capabilities and features: ML experimentation, training, a central model registry, model deployment, and model monitoring. The application must ensure secure and isolated use of training data during the ML lifecycle. The training data is stored in Amazon S3. The company is experimenting with consecutive training jobs. How can the company MINIMIZE infrastructure startup times for these jobs?
A. Use Managed Spot Training.
*B. Use SageMaker managed warm pools.
C. Use SageMaker Training Compiler.
D. Use the SageMaker distributed data parallelism (SMDDP) library.

Q: Case Study - A company is building a web-based AI application by using Amazon SageMaker. The application will provide the following capabilities and features: ML experimentation, training, a central model registry, model deployment, and model monitoring. The application must ensure secure and isolated use of training data during the ML lifecycle. The training data is stored in Amazon S3. The company must implement a manual approval-based workflow to ensure that only approved models can be deployed to production endpoints. Which solution will meet this requirement?
A. Use SageMaker Experiments to facilitate the approval process during model registration.
B. Use SageMaker ML Lineage Tracking on the central model registry. Create tracking entities for the approval process.
C. Use SageMaker Model Monitor to evaluate the performance of the model and to manage the approval.
*D. Use SageMaker Pipelines. When a model version is registered, use the AWS SDK to change the approval status to "Approved."

Q: Case Study - A company is building a web-based AI application by using Amazon SageMaker. The application will provide the following capabilities and features: ML experimentation, training, a central model registry, model deployment, and model monitoring. The application must ensure secure and isolated use of training data during the ML lifecycle. The training data is stored in Amazon S3. The company needs to run an on-demand workflow to monitor bias drift for models that are deployed to real-time endpoints from the application. Which action will meet this requirement?
*A. Configure the application to invoke an AWS Lambda function that runs a SageMaker Clarify job.
B. Invoke an AWS Lambda function to pull the sagemaker-model-monitor-analyzer built-in SageMaker image.
C. Use AWS Glue Data Quality to monitor bias.
D. Use SageMaker notebooks to compare the bias.

Q: Case study - An ML engineer is developing a fraud detection model on AWS. The training dataset includes transaction logs, customer profiles, and tables from an on-premises MySQL database. The transaction logs and customer profiles are stored in Amazon S3. The dataset has a class imbalance that affects the learning of the model's algorithm. Additionally, many of the features have interdependencies. The algorithm is not capturing all the desired underlying patterns in the data. Which AWS service or feature can aggregate the data from the various data sources?
A. Amazon EMR Spark jobs
B. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
C. Amazon DynamoDB
